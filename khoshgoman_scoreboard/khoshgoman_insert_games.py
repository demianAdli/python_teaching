-It is a gussing game with a scoreboard.
-Players can Sign up and track their success in the board.
-They can sign in using their id and passwords whenever.
-Players can play as long as they want to. Each game results
will be submitted to their history on the scoreboard

Story: Player has three chances to guess the summation
of two dices. First two wrong answers will return some guide.

The program was developed for below learning purposes:
- Using functions in the correct and Pythonic way.
- Designing a SQL database
- Connecting the game with the database

In order to use this program, one has to define the
needed tables in their MySql environment.

This file should be run in order to play.
